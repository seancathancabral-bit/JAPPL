JAPPL is a programming language thats significantly under developed bc its just one guy
JAPPL — A Syntax-Tolerant Text Programming Language

JAPPL (Just Another Programming PLatform/Language) is a lightweight, beginner-friendly programming language implemented inside Scratch but designed as an independent text language.
It uses its own compiler, execution engine, memory model, and syntax system.

JAPPL acts as a bridge between Scratch (easy), Python (clean), and Java (structured), allowing new programmers to write real text code with minimal frustration.

the current prototype is implemented on top of scratch using it as a host virtual machine
a standalonh html/js is planned

you are requested to help jappl grow by making a better version of jappl and share it on scratch if the update is good and found by the developer the new feature will 100% be implemented

Key Features
Syntax-tolerant

JAPPL accepts multiple variations of the same command and converts them into clean internal bytecode:

   >print hi 
   >print "hi" 
   >print=hi 


All normalize into:

 >print "hi" 


This makes JAPPL extremely easy for beginners and hard to break.

 Text-based language inside a VM

Even though JAPPL is implemented in Scratch, it is NOT a block-language.
It has:

its own tokenizer

its own compiler

its own bytecode list

its own executor

its own variable RAM

operator engine

sensing system

loops & repeat

custom memory handling

Scratch is used only as the host (like Python being hosted by C).

 Beginner-first design

Built so new programmers can learn coding without syntax nightmares:

plain-English commands

forgiving structure

instant output

consistent behaviour

portable project file

simple mental model

 Core Commands (examples)
>print hello
>wait 1
>clear screen
>make variable x
>set variable x to 4
>repeat infinite
>repeat 10

 Current Version
